# ELT Sensor T-200-3V Series CO2 Sensor Library for Arduino

This library is based off of prior work at https://github.com/mhorimoto/ELT_S300_HOLLY

It utilizes close to identical code as the S-300 series of CO2 sensors. I intend to write an experimental script for calibrating the sensor in conjunction with a suite of sensors tailored to the ESP-IDF rather than arduino, so stay tuned.
