# ELT Sensor T-200-3V Series CO2 Sensor Library for Arduino

This library is based off of prior work that you can find here. In fact, it is nearly identical.

It utilizes close to identical code as the S-300 series of CO2 sensors. To my surprise, merely changing out some of the  I intend to write an experimental script for calibrating the sensor, so stay tuned.
